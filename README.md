# Bitguard

A powerful and secure local password manager built with FastAPI and SQLite, written in Python, including an efficient password generator, a pwned detector and an intuitive manager.

Use a Python virtual environment for dependencies.
Run setup.bat to create and populate itguard-src\\venv (includes FastAPI + uvicorn).
You can install 
equests or other packages in the activated venv with pip install requests or add them to 
equirements.txt.

After activating, start the API:

`
cd bitguard-src
call venv\\Scripts\\activate
python main.py
`
